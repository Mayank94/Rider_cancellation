# Food Delivery Partner Order Cancellation Prediction

Welcome to the Food Delivery Partner Order Cancellation Prediction project! In this repository, we have developed a robust predictive model that aims to foresee whether a food delivery partner is likely to cancel an order. By leveraging extensive feature engineering and ensembling various machine learning models, we can predict potential cancellations in advance, allowing for efficient reassignment of orders to different riders and minimizing customer inconvenience.

## Introduction

Order cancellations by delivery partners can lead to customer dissatisfaction and operational inefficiencies. To address this issue, we have developed a predictive model that forecasts the likelihood of a food delivery partner canceling an order. By using historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, we can help food delivery platforms take proactive measures to reassign orders and maintain a smooth customer experience.

## Dataset

Our model is trained on a real-world dataset containing historical information about food delivery orders and the behavior of delivery partners. The dataset includes various features such as partner demographics, order details, time of day, and more. This rich dataset forms the foundation of our predictive model.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of predictive models. We have meticulously crafted and selected features that capture the nuanced patterns associated with order cancellations. Some of the features we engineered include:

- Partner's cancellation history
- Partner's acceptance rate
- Partner's Reliability
- Distance to delivery location
- Time of day effects

These features, along with others, enable our model to learn from historical patterns and make accurate predictions.

## Ensemble of Models

Our predictive model employs an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to leverage their individual strengths and enhance overall prediction accuracy. We have experimented with various algorithms, including:

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- AdaBoost

The combination of these models into an ensemble framework provides a robust prediction mechanism that can generalize well to new data.

## Usage

To use our prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt`.
3. Prepare your input data in the same format as our training data.
4. Use the provided scripts to preprocess the data and apply the ensemble model for predictions.


By leveraging the power of predictive analytics, our Food Delivery Partner Order Cancellation Prediction Model aims to optimize food delivery operations and ensure a seamless experience for customers and partners alike. We believe that proactive order reassignment can significantly reduce cancellations and contribute to the overall efficiency of food delivery platforms.
